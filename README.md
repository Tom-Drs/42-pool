# 42 Pool

I participated in the pool of 42 Lyon in August 2022 at the age of 18 years.
I share my pool for educational purposes and not for cheating. Anyway if you cheat 42 will know and you will not be admitted.

In the second branch of this repo I will try to finish the pool and correct all my mistakes to improve 🚀

Thanks again to all those present during this pool, I lived a lot of unforgettable moments. Thanks to the Bocal, the BDE, the Foyer and the Tutors 🙏
